summary    : A BitTorrent library written in C++
description: "LibTorrent is a BitTorrent library written in C++ for *nix,\nwith a focus on high performance and good code. The library \ndifferentiates itself from other implementations by transfering\n\
    directly from file pages to the network stack. On high-bandwidth\nconnections it is able to seed at 3 times the speed of the official\nclient.\n"
